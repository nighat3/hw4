Render App URL: https://hw4-jm0w.onrender.com
NOTE: Render is behaving weirdly with my image uploads for posts/entries. As you can see on the app under Boston and Chicago, some entries' images load just fine while others sporadically stop loading. At the time of uploading, all images were showing correctly. However, when I went back to verify, the images sometimes don't show even though they are being stored and uploaded correctly in other cases directly next to each other.
